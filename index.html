                    <h2 class="display-4">Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Technology is beautiful. The internet has defined a new age of humanity: the information age. Today we are connected in ways unlike those offered to any other generation. We can collaborate, learn, and play together without regard to where we physically are in the real world. Information travels at the speed of light. We have created an entirely new universe: the digital world, a world that has given us new ways to innovate and push forward. However, all of this is not without consequences. At the same time that technology helps us, it also distracts us. When constantly bombarded with an ebbing and flowing vortex of information that is the internet, it becomes increasingly difficult to focus our attention on one particular thing and get anything meaningful done. These distractions are why the average attention span of Gen Z is just eight seconds (McSpadden, 2015). Technology is a double-edged sword. The question is, how much time should children be spending in this digital world? There are at least three approaches to managing screen time, and I suggest that each option should be used at different times.</p>

                        <p>The first option would be to simply keep technology away from children, or to highly limit it. This option is be great for very young children, and I think it's a smart way to go about it until they are nearing the end of elementary school. At this point, it becomes an impractical and perhaps even unwise way to manage children's screen time. Technology is central in today's digital world, and it is crucial that children are exposed to it. Cybersecurity, Computer Programming, Information Technology, Robotics, and Engineering are a few examples of jobs related to screens and technology. Children need to learn how to use technology in order to be ready for the future.</p>

                        <h2 class="display-4">Certain Time Limits</h2>
                        <p>Another option, and one that is widely used today, would be to give your child certain time limits every day to be on screens. This is a sort of middle ground on the issue, and I think it works well in some cases. However, it certainly has its flaws. For one thing, the idea of limiting screen use based on time is becoming increasingly irrellevant in today's world. Children use technology at school to get their work done, for homework, to spend time with their friends, and much more. Especially as highschool approaches, it becomes increasingly hard to use this approach. I for one am in highschool right now, and I do almost all my school on my laptop. I enjoy computer programming as a hobby, and spend much of my free time coding. I also spend lots of time online with friends. You can imagine just how hard this approach becomes to implement.</p>

                        <h2 class="display-4">Self-managed Screen Time</h2>
                        <p>The final possibility would be to let children completely self-manage their screen time. Many parents would certainly cringe at this, but bear with me. As I showed in the last section, during highschool managing technology use based on time becomes increasingly impractical. My suggestion is that parents slowly give more freedom to their children until the point where they completely manage their screen time themselves. If this doesn't happen, when your child steps out the door into the real world, they won't have the skills necessary to manage their time online wisely. In fact, studies have shown that children with highly limited screen time go on to do worse in college, likely because they can't control themselves. Over time, I suggest putting your child in the driver's seat and letting them manage themselves. This will be a bumpy road, but I think it will benefit them in the long run.</p>

                    <h2 class="display-4">Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>To summarize, I think that at the beginning, high restrictions should be placed on technology use, and that over time, children are put in the driver's seat, ready to manage themselves. This balancing act is certainly hard to pull off, and is not a one and done approach. However, I think it is the best way to prepare children for their futures in a technological world.</p>
